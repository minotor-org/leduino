leduino is an Arduino-based LED strips USB interface.

This firmware allow you to drive an FastSPI-compiliant LED strip/modules using Arduino Mega.

Additionnally to the simple USB to LED strip converter, this firmware features a color/brightness correction.

To turn your Arduino Mega into a LEDuino, you need to install FastSPIÂ¹ library, then compile and upload this sketch as usual.

Please that hardware connection between Arduino and your LED strip should follow the FastSPI requierements.
